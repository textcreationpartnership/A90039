         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>OUr Army conſiſting of 1500. Muſquetiers, 200. Pikes, 5. Troops of Horſe, under com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of Sergeant Major General <hi>Chudleigh,</hi> advanced out of Devon. into Cornwall, over Poulſon bridge, neere Lanceſtone, Sunday moring laſt, and there fought with the whole force of Cornwal all that day, till neere midnight, and was in danger to have been cut off, the enemy being ſo many, and having hemm'd them round to ſtop their retreat into Devon. which they had done, had not Col: <hi>Merricks</hi> Regiment of <hi>Lond.</hi> Gray coats, under command of Lieutenant Col. <hi>Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mady,</hi> which went out of Plimouth the Saterday after noone, and reſcued our Army, when the enemy had wel-nigh encompaſſed them round, the gray coats fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling on them bravely, ſo that our Army themſelves killed and hurt them many men, ſome ſay 150. ſo as they made the enemy retreat, and ſo our men came freely off, making an honourable retreat, not loſing any thing, onely having ſome eight or ten men killed at moſt.</p>
            <p>By Munday morning all our Forces were ſafely ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived into Devonſhire againe, and whatever the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:155867:3"/>was, I cannot learne, ſome difference there was, ſo as part of our Army diſperſt themſelves, the reſt being not above 600. Foot and 3. Troops of Horſe, the Tueſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day night quartered at Ockhampton, and about nine of the clock at night unthought on, one of the Quarter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maſters riding out to get quarter to ſome village neere the towne for their Troopers, met three ſcouts of the enemies, who fired their Carbines at him, whereon he ſet ſpurs to his horſe, diſcovered the enemies Armie, which we hear conſiſted of 4000. Foot and 400. horſe and Dragoons marching towards Ockhampton to cut off our Forces there, who little expected them, the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie as it ſeems intending to fall upon them in the dead of the night. But now mark and obſerve the providence of God, moſt wonderfully and miraculouſly, in delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring our Forces from theſe cruel enemies.</p>
            <p>The Sergeant major Generall underſtanding of the enemies neere approach by the Quartermaſters relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, calling a ſudden counſell, preſently commanded the Horſe being but 108. in all, (who were going to their quarters before this news came) to divide themſelves in ſquadrons, having ſpeedly marched firſt to the brow of a hill where the enemy was to paſſe, and in that or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to remaine till the enemy came home upon them, and upon paine of death no man to ſhew himſelf, till the enemy ſhould march full upon them, and when they came, on whoſe quarter ſoever they ſhould firſt light, thoſe ſquadrons firſt to charge, and to charge them through and through, and to ſhout, crying, Fall on, fall on, They run, they run. This being thus brave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and ſpeedily deſigned, was as reſolvedly and vali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>antly
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:155867:3"/>put in execution, for it ſo fell out, that the enemy firſt approached to Captaine <hi>Drakes</hi> quarter, who ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving divided thoſe of his Troop, conſiſting but of 36. into tow ſquadrons of 18. each commanded them to follow him, and not to give fire till they ſee him give fire, and ſo put ſpurs to horſe, and charged the enemies horſe and Dragoons, giving the ſhout, Fall on, fall on, piſtolled the firſt man he met, knockt out the brains of the next with his poll-axe, and ſo made way through for the reſt of his ſquadron, who as bravely followed him, and after him his Lieutenant with the other 18. crying, Fall on, fall on, They run, they run, and on the other parts, Captain <hi>Gold,</hi> Captain <hi>Pym,</hi> Sergeant Major <hi>Chudleigh</hi> himſelfe as bravely fell on the body of the foot, charging them through, making them throw down their Arms, and cry for quarter. This being done, all with 108. Troopers, the Foot remaining in the Town being but about 600. in all, who had command to make good the towne for retreat, where alſo their Ordnance and Ammunition was, after the firſt rout, againe about midnight our enemy faced about againe, when our Foot alſo came out upon 400. of them, and together with about 60. or 70. of the Horſe ſo bravely charged them, that they diſperſt them in a ſhameful manner, make them turne back, and again to retreat for Cornwall. Our Horſe had ſo far purſued them, that they had almoſt got their two braſſe Ordnance, which they had in poſſeſſion, but the Foot were not come up to bring them away: So not being of number ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent, thought it not good to goe too far, but returned back to Ockhampton with honour, being ſo well im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:155867:4"/>in the rout, took onely ſome 20. priſoners, killed ſome 20. more, and not a man of ours loſt. They have taken upon 1000. mens Arms, and 100. in 150. of their horſes.</p>
            <p>We are now gathering a conſiderable army toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and intend by Gods help to march into Cornwall. Our men are now all couragious and hearty, ſeeing the wonderfull mercy of God, who gives the victory to few as well as to many, and fights the battles of his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, to whom be the glory and honour of his mercy and goodneſſe aſcribed forever.</p>

            <p>YOur health wiſhed, &amp;c. I received your Letter by the Poſt, and doe thanke you for your intelligence, our forces being not above 1500. lay on Friday laſt 10. miles from Lanceſtone, but on ſaterday they advanced to Liſton within 3. miles of Lance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone, and yet in Devon where they thought to have met with 3. or 4. regiments of trayners thoſe being all Sea-men and Volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teeres, but there was no aid came thither as was promiſed by the Lieutenants: Sergeant Major <hi>Chudleigh</hi> commanding in chiefe. Of theſe 1500. on Sunday morning at 10. of the clock marched over Poulſon-bridge into Cornewall, upon this ground hearing that there was not above 1000. men and that of Sir <hi>Bevel Greenvils</hi> Regiment, ſo that he thought to have ſet upon Lance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone, but before they came neere the Town the Cavaliers came out and lay halfe a mile off the Towne in hedges, and ſhot upon our men from 10 til 3. or 4. of the clock but our men beate them
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:155867:5"/>from hedge to hedge till they were come neere home to the Towne; and then about 5. or 6. of the clock there was 2. or 3. Regiments came in to the helpe of the Cavaliers, but we held two or three ſmall braſſe peeces which did great execution among them, but their number being ſo much increaſed they were like to have begirt our men round, and had ſent a great number to the bridge, but by the providence of God 500. of the E. of <hi>Stamp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fords</hi> men came in from Plymoth and cleered the bridge, and our men made a faire retreate about 9. of the clock at night on Sunday and marched to Southhampton, but I muſt tell you that our men killed above 20. for one, we loſt but 8. men, and they loſt above 200. and ſome ſay for certain 240. whereof M. <hi>Baſſet</hi> their high Sheriffe was one ſhot in two by our braſſe peeces, bleſſed be God for this mercie. Well, our men on Munday came to Southhamp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton 15. miles from Lanſon in the way to Exeter: The Cavaliers on Tueſday advanced from Lanſon into Devon, Sir <hi>Ralph</hi> came hut with 4000. almoſt ſtarved poore Corniſh and 500. horſe, our men by their Scouts ſent out, brought newes to Major <hi>Chudleigh</hi> that the Corniſh Armie was within 4. miles of the Towne, they ſent out 3. Troopes of Horſe, Major <hi>Chudleigh,</hi> Captaine <hi>Gould</hi> and Cap. <hi>Drake</hi> which in all made but 108. horſe, who lay cloſe under a hill where the enemie was to come, who juſt in the edge of the evening came to the place, our horſe poſſeſſed, our men preſently charged the Van very furiouſly, got their word, and fell in among them pel mel: Cap: <hi>Drake</hi> ſlew 12. or 13. with his battel axe and ſword, and one of his Corporals the like number, he charged through and through the midſt of the Armie, and had the foote come up had gotten their guns, being 3. they had poſſeſſion of them but wanted foote to carry them away: It is thought the Cavaliers kild one another, ſeeing they ſaw them kill their fellows that had the worde, there was no difference but our men in the moonelight knew every one by his skarfe and colours, our men killed above 120. of them, tooke 6. or 700. Arms, buffe coats and ſcarlet coates ſtore, 12. drums, 3. Enſines. 11. priſoners, ſwans feathers and much other pillage, and beate them back to Lanceſtone where they ſhamefully arived wedneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:155867:5"/>the faſt day, but we muſt not aſcribe it to man but to God, that they had this great ſucceſſe, being above 45. to one man. One thing is remarkable, that as ſoon our horſe charged them being on a great downe; it grew darke and it thundered and lightned in a very terrible manner, and the thunderclap brake juſt over their heads and then raine extraordinary, and it was a very great winde and hard weather all that day and night, and they were amazed at our ſuddain charge, that they ran amain to ſave their lives, ſo let all our enimies periſh.</p>
            <p>There was a Letter intercepted which came from the King, go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to Sir <hi>Ralph Hopton</hi> 3. or 4. dayes ſince neere <hi>Exon</hi> wherein he wrote that he ſhould come away to his helpe ſpeedily, and it is thought that if he could have cut off that little force wee had in Southhampton then hee would have plundered the Countrey where he had gone, and ſo gon away to the King, but he is gone to his corner with weeping croſſe: Lord Major loſt his, ſcarlet coate and Sir <hi>Straning</hi> his skarfe and many beaver hats found cut and hewed, it is thought is 5000. hurt of them, hee loſt in the laſt fight 5. or 6. horſes but not one man, and 3. or 4. hurt, Gods name be gloriſied. Pray let us heare what newes, you I hope this weeke will produce great newes, God ſend it to be good, under God this war dothly much on the E. of <hi>Eſſex</hi> his Army if well or ill, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it concernes London to afford him all the helpe you poſſible can, your true friend for Jeruſalems peace, I reſt,</p>
